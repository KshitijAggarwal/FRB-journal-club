# FRB Journal Club

Public repository for FRB Journal Club at Department of Physics and Astronomy at WVU. Take a look at these review articles: [Fast Radio Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07947) and [The Physical Mechanisms of Fast Radio Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03500), for an observational and theoretical introduction of FRBs.
